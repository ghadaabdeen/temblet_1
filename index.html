       <center> <p class="bodyclass">Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is the study of making machines more human-like in their behaviour and decisions by giving them the ability to learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the processNow you may wonder, how is it different from traditional programming? Well, in traditional programming, we would feed the input data and a well written and tested program into a machine to generate output. When it comes to machine learning, input data along with the output is fed into the machine during the learning phase, and it works out a program for itself. To understand this better, refer to the illustration below Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves Machine learning is important because it gives enterprises a view of trends in customer behavior and business operational patterns, as well as supports the development of new products. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part</p></center>
